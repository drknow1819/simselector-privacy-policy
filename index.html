    <p><strong>SIM Selector Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 7, 2025</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy describes how the <strong>SIM Selector</strong> mobile application ("the App"), provided by <strong>SmartServe Labs</strong> ("we," "us," or "our"), handles information. The App is provided as an ad-supported service.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>1. Information We DO NOT Collect, Store, or Transmit Directly</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>SIM Selector</strong> app itself is designed to function primarily on your device. We want to be clear:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The App <strong>does not collect, store, or transmit any personal, call-log, contact, or precise location data</strong> from your device to our servers or any third parties, except as explicitly described in the "Information Collected by Third-Party Services" section below.</li>
  <li>All access to sensitive data, such as call logs and contacts, is processed <strong>in-memory only</strong> for the purpose of displaying information to you within the App's user interface. <strong>Nothing from your call logs, contacts, or device identifiers is saved by the App or shared with us or any third parties</strong> for purposes other than those specified in the "Information Collected by Third-Party Services" section.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p><strong>2. Information Collected by Third-Party Services</strong></p>
<p>This App utilizes third-party services that may collect information according to their own privacy policies. These services are primarily for advertising and analytics.</p>
<p><strong>Google AdMob:</strong> The Google AdMob SDK embedded within this App may collect the following data to serve and target ads, and for ad delivery and measurement:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Advertising ID:</strong> Used for displaying personalized advertisements and measuring ad campaign performance.</li>
  <li><strong>Device Identifiers:</strong> (including Advertising ID & other device-level identifiers): For ad delivery, measurement, and fraud prevention.</li>
  <li><strong>Approximate Location:</strong> (derived from IP address): To personalize ads based on general geographic area.</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<hr>

<p><strong>3. How We Use Information (App Functionality)</strong></p>
<p>The data accessed by the <strong>SIM Selector</strong> app (which is processed in-memory as described in Section 1) is used solely for the following core functionalities:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Dialer Calls:</strong> To enable you to place phone calls using the correct SIM card selected within the App.</li>
  <li><strong>Call History Display:</strong> To display your recent call logs in the Call History tab, helping you manage calls per SIM.</li>
  <li><strong>Contacts Display:</strong> To display your contact list in the Contacts tab, allowing you to easily select contacts for calling.</li>
  <li><strong>SIM-Mapping Settings:</strong> To manage and apply your preferred SIM card settings for calls and related actions.</li>
  <li><strong>Service Stability:</strong> To ensure the core call-routing service remains active and provides uninterrupted functionality.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p><strong>4. Permissions Requested and Their Purpose</strong></p>
<p>For the App to function correctly, it requires certain permissions. These permissions are requested at runtime, typically upon your first launch or when you try to access a feature that requires them. <strong>Each permission request is accompanied by a clear, on-screen explanation within the App</strong> detailing why it's needed for the App's core functionality. No permission is requested silently; you must explicitly approve each one to proceed.</p>

<p>Below is a list of key permissions the App requests and their specific uses:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong><code>android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE</code>:</strong> Crucial for identifying the presence and status of multiple SIM cards on your device, detecting network information, and monitoring ongoing call status.</li>
  <li><strong><code>android.permission.CALL_PHONE</code>:</strong> To directly initiate phone calls using the specific SIM card selected in the App.</li>
  <li><strong><code>android.permission.MANAGE_OWN_CALLS</code>:</strong> To allow the App to manage calls via Android's <code>ConnectionService</code> API and support multi-SIM routing.</li>
  <li><strong><code>android.permission.READ_CALL_LOG</code> / <code>WRITE_CALL_LOG</code>:</strong> To read and annotate call history displayed in the Call History tab. This is processed <strong>in-memory only</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong><code>android.permission.READ_CONTACTS</code>:</strong> To allow contact selection when placing calls. Data is processed <strong>in-memory only</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong><code>android.permission.PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS</code>:</strong> To monitor background restriction and battery optimization affecting the call-routing service.</li>
  <li><strong><code>android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE</code> / <code>FOREGROUND_SERVICE_PHONE_CALL</code>:</strong> To keep SIM management active even in the background.</li>
  <li><strong><code>android.permission.INTERNET</code> / <code>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE</code>:</strong> Required for displaying ads and checking for app updates.</li>
  <li><strong><code>android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS</code>:</strong> To send SIM reminders or activity-related alerts.</li>
  <li><strong><code>android.permission.WAKE_LOCK</code>:</strong> To keep the CPU awake during SIM switching and call operations.</li>
  <li><strong><code>android.permission.REORDER_TASKS</code>:</strong> To bring SIM selector to foreground quickly during outgoing calls.</li>
  <li><strong><code>com.android.vending.BILLING</code> / <code>CHECK_LICENSE</code>:</strong> For in-app purchases and license validation.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p><strong>5. Data Retention</strong></p>
<p>As stated in Section 1, the <strong>SIM Selector</strong> app does not store your personal, call-log, contact, or location data. Information accessed from your device is processed in-memory and not retained by the App.</p>
<p>Data collected by third-party services (e.g., Google AdMob) is retained according to their respective privacy policies.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>6. Your Opt-Out Rights</strong></p>
<p>You can stop all collection of information by uninstalling the App. Use the standard uninstall process via your device settings or the Google Play Store.</p>
<p>To opt out of personalized ads, you may be able to reset your Advertising ID through your device settings.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>7. Children's Privacy</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>SIM Selector</strong> App does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us at the email below so we can take appropriate action.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>8. Security</strong></p>
<p>We take reasonable steps to safeguard the confidentiality of the limited information we process. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your data, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page. You are advised to review it periodically. Continued use of the App after changes are posted signifies your acceptance.</p>
